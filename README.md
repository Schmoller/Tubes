### API Usage
The prefered method for using Tubes API is to put a dev version jar on the build path and just reference it.

If you need to include source code from Tubes, please only include exactly which files you need.

### Languages
If you wish to contribute a language please use the en_US.lang file in the assets/lang directory as the base for translations

Once you have finished a translation please submit a Pull Request.
Please remember to use **UTF-8** encoding on language files.

### Building
Make sure you have python installed and available on the system PATH.

[Download this and put the contents in a folder named "lib".](http://files.holenet.info/lib.zip)
